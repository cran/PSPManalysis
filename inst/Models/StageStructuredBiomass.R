# Model dimension variables: PSPMdimensions (required)
#
# Define a numerical (integer) vector called 'PSPMdimensions' that specifies the
# dimensions of the model. The vector should include the following named vecctor
# elements:
#
# PopulationNr:       The number of populations in the model that are structured,
#                     that is, of which the life history of individuals is explicitly
#                     modelled
# IStateDimension:    The number of individual state variables that characterise the
#                     individuals in the structured populations. This number should be
#                     the same for all structured populations in the model
# LifeHistoryStages:  The number of distinct and discrete stages in the life history
#                     of the individuals. A part of the individual life history is
#                     considered a stage, when at the boundary of this part one of the
#                     life history processes (development, fecundity, mortality or
#                     impact) changes discontinuously
# ImpactDimension:    The number of functions that represent the impact of an individual
#                     on its environment. At the population level these impacts
#                     affect the dynamics of the environemtal state variables and hence
#                     determine their equilibrium values. Impact functions can, however,
#                     also be used to extract certain output information on the
#                     structured populations (such as number of biomass of juveniles and
#                     adults) as all population-level values of the impact functions
#                     are reported as output.
#
# An error will occur when one of the above named elements is missing.
#
PSPMdimensions <- c(PopulationNr = 1, IStateDimension = 2, LifeHistoryStages = 2, ImpactDimension = 3)


#
# Variable name: NumericalOptions (optional)
#
# Define a numerical vector called 'NumericalOptions' the elements of which specify
# the optional numerical settings to tweak the computations. The elements of the
# vector should have names corresponding to one of the possible numerical settings
# (see the vignette). Examples of such numerical settings are 'MIN_SURVIVAL = 1.0E-9'
# and 'RHSTOL = 1.0E-6', which set the survivial at which the individual is considered
# dead and the tolerance value determining when a solution has been found, respectively.

                      DYTOL         = 1.0E-7,                                       # Variable tolerance

#
# Variable name: EnvironmentState (required)
#
# Define a vector called 'EnvironmentState' with a length equal to the number of
# environmental state variables in the problem. Each element of this vector should be
# one of the strings "PERCAPITARATE", "GENERALODE" or "POPULATIONINTEGRAL", defining
# the nature or type of environmental state variable. The 3 different types are defined
# as follows:
#
# Set an entry to "PERCAPITARATE" if the dynamics of E[j] follow an ODE and 0
# is a possible equilibrium state of E[j]. The ODE is then of the form
# dE[j]/dt = P(E,I)*E[j], with P(E,I) the per capita growth rate of E[j].
# Specify the equilibrium condition as condition[j] = P(E,I), do not include
# the multiplication with E[j] to allow for detecting and continuing the
# transcritical bifurcation between the trivial and non-trivial equilibrium.
#
# Set an entry to "GENERALODE" if the dynamics of E[j] follow an ODE and 0 is
# NOT an equilibrium state of E. The ODE then has a form dE[j]/dt = G(E,I).
# Specify the equilibrium condition as condition[j] = G(E,I).
#
# Set an entry to "POPULATIONINTEGRAL" if E[j] is a (weighted) integral of the
# population distribution, representing for example the total population
# biomass. E[j] then can be expressed as E[j] = I[p][i]. Specify the
# equilibrium condition in this case as condition[j] = I[p][i].

# at birth for the particular i-state variable. If the members of the vector are given
# meaningful names, these names can be used conveniently in the functions below that define
# the life history processes.
#
# If individuals can differ in their individual state at birth this function should return a
# matrix with the number of rows equal to the number of possible states at birth and the number
# of columns equal to the number of i-state variables. Each row then specifies the value of the
# individual state variable of the particualr state at birth.
#
# In case the model accounts for multiple, structured populations this function should return a
# a matrix with the number of rows equal to the number of structured populations in the problem
# and the number of columns equal to the number of i-state variables.
#
# In case the model accounts for multiple, structured populations and individuals can differ in
# their individual state at birth this function should return a 3-dimensional array with the
# first dimension having a length equal to the number of structured populations in the problem,

# equal to the number of i-state variables.
